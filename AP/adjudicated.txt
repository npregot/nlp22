1	adjudicated	2	they should let the vote count on posts go negative so we could see how hated this announcement actually is.
2	adjudicated	1	/r/apolloapp is the spiritual successor to alienblue.
3	adjudicated	2	"so weird. ""we didn't take this decision lightly"", but we won't tell you why. ""the power of reddit gifts has always been because of the community, not the software"", so we are cancelling the already-working software in order to focus our efforts on unrelated software. ""no one can sign up for the gift exchange anymore, and it will end soon. anyone who has an incomplete gift exchange will be permanently banned from the closed community that we are soon deleting."" this is the most blatant corporate double-speak i've heard in a long while."
4	adjudicated	2	we should go back to just posting that picture of reddit silver with the s backwards and whatever instead of spending coins to have an official useless icon.
5	adjudicated	3	reddit as a brand new user today is an absolutely horrible experience. if this is what the site looked like when it was originally launched it would have never taken off.
6	adjudicated	2	"> lastly, i'm sure this will be ignored, but i would like to offer to completely take over redditgifts again. you can keep everything about it, i will even run your ads and you can keep all of the profits. i will pay for hosting, do all developments and support/community work. fuck if reddit lets you ""formally"" continue it, just do it mate, you have the power"
7	adjudicated	2	bruh they couldn't even help themselves when they made reddit silver a real thing you could buy after people sarcastically used it as a 'reward' in comments
8	adjudicated	2	if they ever stop old.reddit that may be the day i actually quit, the new experience is so laggy on my tablet despite all this time
9	adjudicated	2	just wait until they shut down old.reddit.com
10	adjudicated	1	my guinness world record certificate is still in the envelope i got it in years ago lol. this is how good i've gotten at procrastinating, i've been always postponing having it framed
11	adjudicated	1	"yup. that's the, ""so you're skipping plan a? good luck."" look. you can definitely tell how bold of a choice she thinks it is."
12	adjudicated	1	maybe she's just wondering why you're recording her.
13	adjudicated	1	actually, the first three items was lubricant if you think about it
14	adjudicated	2	or maybe dude just took a picture of the car? what good would a qr code that links to a picture of the parking job be to the person who finds that on their car, where it was parked poorly?
15	adjudicated	2	i mean wouldn't you prefer it be staged over this actually happening? or shall we *enjoy suffering*
16	adjudicated	1	very active one would say
17	adjudicated	2	plus textured hair is a bitch and a half to manage. i'm a dude with long hair and it's already hard enough. one of my smoking buddies from when i worked next to a cosmetology school also said the white girls would always ask *her* to do the textured hair so often it seems white stylists don't even bother to learn.
18	adjudicated	1	the wig holds the power
19	adjudicated	1	100% correct
20	adjudicated	1	"i asked a friend from high school about this and i still remember her answer. ""imagine waking up everyday and having constantly good looking hair. it's like that in 6 hours, 6 months, even year and you can shave your own hair blindfolded and it won't even matter"" i was like damn, she's right."
21	adjudicated	3	people who do this have absolutely no idea how gas prices work or get set. you would do better to go after the companies that purchased the gas they are selling you a month ago at a much discounted price and are now gouging you. christ people are idiots
22	adjudicated	1	as a brit, i'm confused as to why biden has anything to do with fuel prices going up massively over here.
23	adjudicated	1	i dont do any of this stuff but i am in favor of destroying all property and return to bog thing
24	adjudicated	1	dad is hvac, they apparently frequently don't hold a human weight either.
25	adjudicated	1	ouch, sprog, right in the feels... thank you.
26	adjudicated	1	when one is coming right at you, it looks slower than it actually is, similar to a train. aaaand then it flies by and you realize it was *hauling ass* source: near-miss with an rpg, where i just looked at it dumbly.
27	adjudicated	2	when you look at the people who were in charge of greenlighting films through the 80s, 90s and 00s, it makes a lot of sense that most male characters are creepy fucks.
28	adjudicated	1	"i saw it before me in shadows of doubt - my means to salvation, my only way out. it sat there in silence, and captured me, caught - immune to my heartache, and deaf to my thought. ""i don't want a future,"" i solemnly swore - ""of sadness and silence and loss anymore. i don't want a witness to witness goodbye - i just wanted someone to care when i cry."" i looked at it, waiting, and muttered a vow: ""whatever. let's do it. it's never or now. i'm ending it here, of an evening, alone."" i reached out before me. and picked up the phone."
29	adjudicated	1	thank you for your warm wishes. mom has since passed on, so i like to imagine she's up there giving him an ear full.
30	adjudicated	1	heartbreaking. people that are homeless are so misunderstood and underapreciated, pets are really the only ones that see them for their heart and not their struggles. i hope he is okay, you did good in trying to be there for him as much as possible, i am sure he appreciated that. did the police go there at all to investigate?
31	adjudicated	1	Mario is basically a general mascot for video games in general. Since it doesn't have the name of the game it's sort of a timeless mural
32	adjudicated	2	"yeah, i do wish people would stop confusing these two things. a world where every game ""story"" was dark souls would suck."
33	adjudicated	2	story =/= lore. lore is background and setting, story is a narrative through-line that tells you why you are here, what you are doing and so forth. they aren't the same. games like doom and dark souls tells its lore through environmental elements, context clues and collectible doohickies you can find and read shit in menus. the story is the here and now, that you are just some dude, you woke up and now you gotta go kill shit.
34	adjudicated	2	that... and people are dumb, which us why movies are mostly just exposition. good movies are few. building it towards the crowd that needs exposition is better business, unfortunatly.
35	adjudicated	2	id software: we don't need lore for doom players: omg what's the background lore with the slayer? is he the same as doomguy? who is this robot dude? what is going on??/
36	adjudicated	1	depends though in dark souls it works. in final fantasy or the last of us for example not so much
37	adjudicated	2	i remember finishing rdr1 and feeling sad and wishing i could go back to being john. then rdr2 comes out, and i still wish i could play as john. then i beat rdr2 and it let me play as john.....but i didn't want that anymore.
38	adjudicated	2	>so, according to riot, despite over 100 women being paid out due to sexual harassment and gender discrimination in assignment, delegation of duties, and promotions, there isn't a systemic problem. lmao what
39	adjudicated	1	it comes with the green box featuring quarter life 2
40	adjudicated	2	what does it run...i'm curious....looks like someone modelled frosting with green jello and left it in the fridge
41	adjudicated	1	omg! poor mom is so worried her puppies won't understand the joy of the ball!
42	adjudicated	2	to me, she's saying: 1. identify the father. 2. locate him. 3. destroy him.
43	adjudicated	1	yeah, it looks like an animated cat travelling around a diorama.
44	adjudicated	1	jungle penguins.
45	adjudicated	2	"it is the thought ""atleast i won a medal"" for the person coming in third versus the ""silver is the prize the first loser gets"" that predominates the person coming in second. or so i heard my medals were mostly in the ""participant"" category..."

47	adjudicated	1	like a chicken i assume
48	adjudicated	1	i love his struggle of being curious and afraid at the same time. cute little fella!
49	adjudicated	2	and at least she got bronze, statistically speaking bronze medalists fair better in life that silver medalists for some reason haha no idea why but i remember reading that somewhere
50	adjudicated	1	i could never be a wild lifer photographer, because they are instructed to not interact with said animals. how am i supposed ro ignore sure cute little thing like this?
51	adjudicated	1	you were better at sports
52	adjudicated	1	here in the american midwest you hear it all the time during 90s throwback days on the radio. it was very much a hit, and still pretty iconic.
53	adjudicated	1	it was a massive hit in california too, although it took longer to reach us it was still a top 10 and you couldn't go anywhere in 97 without hearing it.
54	adjudicated	1	this played in walmart the other day. i immediately did the neck wiggle. another dude saw and did it right back, much to his wife/girlfriend's horror.
55	adjudicated	1	can't pick just one, my top 3 are: kung fu fighting by carl douglas pump up the volume by ring my bell by anita ward
56	adjudicated	1	wait that song made it out new zealand? crazy. what a throwback jam
57	adjudicated	1	mark morrison-return of the mack
58	adjudicated	1	third eye blind was never a one hit wonder. they had semi-charmed life for sure but also jumper and i'll never let you go. probably others i've forgotten as well.
59	adjudicated	1	for me, it's that thing you do by the oneders. (also groove is in the heart)
60	adjudicated	1	that entire first album of theirs is an unappreciated classic of late-90s alt. we've redeemed third eye blind, now where's the love for harvey danger, dammit?
61	adjudicated	3	goddammit... yet again i read this, then looked to see who posted it, and it realised it was u/shittymorph themselves, again. from now until the end of time, i'm going to read the redditor's name first, before i read any messages...
62	adjudicated	1	the man, the meme, the legend.

66	adjudicated	2	i haven't seen a shittymorph in the wild in years. this is just as good
67	adjudicated	1	i feel like this post is what your reddit career has been leading towards. if i were your father; i may have openly shed a tear of pride.
68	adjudicated	1	you're famous! congrats /u/shittymorph
69	adjudicated	1	remember that time when this meme came at you expectedly? yeah, it was today.
70	adjudicated	1	"""....hey babe! i have an idea for the next time we host game night."""
71	adjudicated	2	totally. if me predicting russia will invade every day stops the invasion i'll see you tomorrow when russia invades ukraine!
72	adjudicated	1	and reduce the probability of turkey (a nato member) from attacking or being attacked by russia. didn't turkey shoot down a russian military jet not that long ago?
73	adjudicated	3	what are you talking about? it's completely normal to have military training exercises with an invasion level force on three sides bordering a neighboring country you previously invaded and are verbally threatening the sovereignty of daily. why is the west being so dramatic???
74	adjudicated	2	it seems like the biden team has been playing putin's game well. they called him out on his plans. i think they were fully aware that announcing putin was planning to invade today would lead to putin refusing to invade ukraineat least for the time being.
75	adjudicated	2	this. it's not about embarrassment or being wrong, it's about peace.
76	adjudicated	3	still 150k troops on the border... in a country with literally more land mass than any other on the planet and they just happen to choose to surround the entire ukraine from the eastern side...
77	adjudicated	2	as long as the chance to prove us wrong prevents an invasion, they can laugh at us all they want. laughter > slaughter.
78	adjudicated	2	putin got caught before the crime with red flag operations. thats why they still havent invaded - they trying to figure out new propaganda, for the invasion. let them ridicule. every extra day helps ukraine, not russia.
79	adjudicated	1	we are. we've entered the fog of war phase. expect disinformation from both sides, right or wrong.
80	adjudicated	1	it's very likely a uk gov source leaking to the mirror. there is a cobra meeting on today so my guess is this 'story' is actually one of several scenarios that ministers are being briefed on. someone has probably leaked a few details of the most 'severe' scenario and they've run with it.
81	adjudicated	1	it's official now: literally everyone can and will be in this movie.
82	adjudicated	3	the bomb. it's nuclear! nuclear!!!
83	adjudicated	1	wow quite the career jump for him. nice revival roles for him and josh hartnett even if their roles are small.
84	adjudicated	2	oppenheimer, where's the nuke?
85	adjudicated	3	the lord of the rings' legacy is they're fucking awesome
86	adjudicated	2	i agree, vin diesel was 34 when the first f&f movie. that's plenty young to get someone more age appropriate to the role and have a long lived franchise.
87	adjudicated	1	">""fortunately he died of a non-traumatic heart attack"" i just read something like this in an obituary. he died peacefully from a heart attack after having played in a golf tournament. that ""peacefully"" feels like it's a placeholder for a whole lot of stuff."

90	adjudicated	1	"""when me and j were in nam."""
91	adjudicated	2	that big of a sex gap raises some questions about the methodology on this one.
92	adjudicated	1	sorry for my laziness not reading the entire study. but is there an hypothesis on the vast difference between men and women? i understand that higher cardiovascular risk in general for men is a factor, but doesn't explain this enormous gap in benifit from exercise i suppose.
93	adjudicated	1	it does happen though. my partner is 30 and was diagnosed last week with heart disease after he collapsed at work. and this is a dude who isn't overweight, exercises daily, runs, plays sports, doesn't smoke/drink, does meditation and other stress management things.
94	adjudicated	1	yeah, this has to be an element of this issue at times too. my mom was dismissed for weeks when she went to the doctors and er repeatedly with severe head pain. come to find out she had a brain tumour that was bleeding on her brain. a student in my graduating class at uni is a super fit young woman, even taught free yoga classes sometimes at campus. she was dismissed for her chest pain and exhaustion, they told her it was gas and/or anxiety. she ended up having heart disease. i went to the er once bleeding from a miscarriage, and they didn't believe me when i said i was losing a lot of blood. i ended up almost bleeding out in the triage room. i'm not saying that 100% of poor health outcomes for women are based in medical biases, but i think that people do underestimate how real of a problem this is for women.
95	adjudicated	1	52% in men is a big motivator. 8% in women, not so much. such a big difference is fascinating
96	adjudicated	2	obesity in the us is out of control. when you in your 20s and 30s you're not expected to have heart problem if your not overweigh.
97	adjudicated	1	ok now do the article about how wages are too low for anyone to have healthy diets and proper health care to keep their bodies and hearts fit. also add in there how women are not taken seriously in healthcare because of the misogyny written into all the studies and guidelines that also keep women i poorer health. then we can have real conversation
98	adjudicated	3	yeah well most people are sick and fat so.
99	adjudicated	1	"you're right, the article's definition of heart health: >optimal heart health was defined as having a normal body weight with a body mass index (bmi) between 18-24.9 kg.m2, and not having hypertension or diabetes. using this definition, many people in larger bodies would be considered as having poor heart health, even if relatively active. on the other hand, many people with ""optimally"" sized bodies would be considered to have healthy hearts despite having zero direct observations of their heart or cardiovascular performance."
100	adjudicated	1	and if you include overweight people it goes up to 68.4%. so nearly 7/10 american women are not at a healthy weight.
101	adjudicated	1	knock knock who's there? dishes. dishes who? dishes sean connery.
102	adjudicated	2	clearing the way is not called helicopter parenting. the term for that is lawnmower parenting. it is even worst than the helicopter parent.
103	adjudicated	1	in sweden, a hen mom is different from a curling parent. a hen mom isn't actively doing anything to help her (or his) kids, but is anxious about everything their kids do. while a curling parent actively clears the path for their kids. at least that's how i interpret it, but others might disagree.
104	adjudicated	1	i lack some of the connective tissue you're supposed to have in your shoulders. because of this, if i relax i can pull my shoulders out of the socket at will. sometimes i'll do it accidentally, things like carrying heavy groceries can pull my shoulders out of place if i'm not careful. it doesn't usually hurt, but if i pull my arm too hard or in the wrong direction like that i can hurt myself. one night i fell asleep with my arms folded behind my head. at some point as i fell asleep, my shoulders must have relaxed and dislocated from the weird position. i woke up with both arms totally dead asleep, no feeling at all, both shoulders dislocated, and both arms tangled around each other. not able to feel anything and knowing i could really hurt myself if i moved wrong, i thought i was going to be stuck like that forever. took ages to manage to untangle one just enough to get it into a position that restored the feeling a little, which let me get it back into the socket. then i could finally use that arm to carefully twist back around the other arm and get it into the socket as well.
105	adjudicated	1	"happen to me once when i fell asleep on it... arm was super cold compared to my body and extremely heavy and in pain and completely ""dead"" like i couldn't even move my fingers , i dont think i ever had such a panic attack like that before i remember holding my arm with my hand and hoping i didnt do long term damage. feeling and warmth came back after a few minutes but it seemed like an eternity"
106	adjudicated	1	jamen for helvede da
107	adjudicated	2	i like it a lot, but i don't like that this analogy implies that the hovering is *actually* clearing the way for the kid to do well and go further. helicopter parents hover, but actually just give away their position and aren't nearly as helpful as they think they are.
108	adjudicated	2	so you've one part of your body that's warm, tanned and in perfect comfort? actually; don't answer.
109	adjudicated	2	"in france we call hen parents or more like ""hen mom"" or ""hen dad"", because they sit on the eggs and overprotect them"
110	adjudicated	1	ha! just like the rest of my body
111	adjudicated	1	we make fun of this, but the guys who made this clearly love making movies. there's a charm to that.
112	adjudicated	1	the whole movie is on youtube, great time killer and it's only an hour long who killed captain alex is the name
113	adjudicated	2	"ercot - electric ""reliability"" council of texas. gotta love how ""reliable"" the system was during that storm as people froze to death. gotta love the emails sent out to customers all year long every year suggesting that they conserve their energy use in order to minimize power outages. bitch, that's your one job!"
114	adjudicated	1	press the bomb
115	adjudicated	2	the reason is always about money!
116	adjudicated	2	"yeah, its a pretty rough one. whats that shower thought from forever ago? ""having a mid-life crisis is like playing an rpg and realizing half-way through that you hate your character but you can't respec skills and there's only one game ever."""

118	adjudicated	2	"labeling an affordable development ""gentrification"" based on aesthetics seems very on-brand for tik tok level of analysis. and makes very worried that people are getting their policy analysis via tik tok."
119	adjudicated	1	it's catchy as hell no doubt. but the meaning is terrifying.
120	adjudicated	1	and he was only 25 when he wrote it.
121	adjudicated	2	"i'm sitting there (tiny hand movements) slaving away for america. when the cockpit door. bursts open (head tilt for no reason) and the pilot says: ""mr. trump you're the only one who can land this plane, nobody else can do it not even me."" i said ""that's no problem, i've landed many planes before i can do it again."" and i did, it was no problem at all. everyone was celebrating on the tarmac, champagne the whole nine yards it was tremendous the best champagne you've ever tasted, everyone says so. but not me (looks insane), i got right back to work trying to make america great again, everyone was thanking me. i said ""if only i could be on every flight with engine failure, but i can't. i'm only one man, and you're gonna miss me when i'm gone. they tell me everyday :""mr. president, please come back.. sleepy joe is ruining.. look what he's done in ukraine they say. i'm tired that's enough"
122	adjudicated	3	i just want to see trump in prison for the rest of life personally. putin on the other hand i'd like to see dragged by horse down a gravel road until his head falls off.
123	adjudicated	2	agreed, and russian bots keep saying that the us is gaslighting and russia isn't going to do anything. we're literally just broadcasting what they're doing. it's back up by satellite pictures and everything.
124	adjudicated	2	he was there to beat that man's ass for who he was, nit what he looked like lol
125	adjudicated	1	it was very well played by this administration to declassify and release intelligence on russian troop movements and communication intercepts as they were being discovered. basically calling out putin's chess moves as he's making them.
126	adjudicated	2	a man's gotta have his principles after all.
127	adjudicated	2	the cop made sure the white kid was ok before leaving him to jump on the black kid, lol. it's so blatant one has to laugh.
128	adjudicated	2	doxxing a doctor who's only trying to save lives. real red-hat thinking, there.
129	adjudicated	2	"""whoa whoa, i was here to fight, not be a part of this racist system!"""
130	adjudicated	2	when the white kid stood up, and both cops were attending the black kid, i thought for sure they would take that as a threat since their backs were basically turned. but no. no reaction from the cops at all. the white kids was obviously not considered threatening at any point.
131	adjudicated	1	*chuck norris, collectors edition*
132	adjudicated	2	*not that dumb!*
133	adjudicated	1	so very true. i'm in so many meetings where people are facing a problem and i know exactly how i could help to solve it. but if i share that idea, it'll just create extra work for me. in those situations it can be preferable to let other people figure out how it can be solved. if i know that they can (and should) do it without my help, i won't say anything. learned that the hard way.
134	adjudicated	1	when i get drunk i play a game where i pretend to not know extremely common things to see who i can fool. ex: bugs bunny, ladders. i've also said that i have an identical twin brother that's 6'3 (i'm 5'5). sober me has decided i need to stop doing this because some people believe me to be an idiot.
135	adjudicated	1	"""yea, i don't know man. go ask steve over there."""
136	adjudicated	1	also to learn. i've been in many situations where i am sure of the right answer, but listen and ask questions instead of explain. either i was wrong, or the person i was talking to had a neat strategy to come to the same conclusion.
137	adjudicated	2	i play dumb so well that \_everybody\_ believes it - my mum, my teachers, my parole officer, all the girls i try and talk to...
138	adjudicated	2	playing dumb at work is important
139	adjudicated	2	but some take it to the point of wanting to shelter them from all forms of sex education as if that'll keep teenagers from having sex. and that does more harm than good.
140	adjudicated	1	i think you mean the smartester people, of which i am one.
141	adjudicated	1	he didn't lie to his wife honesty is always best.
142	adjudicated	1	"exactly. i went from ""trying to be amused"" to ""worried where this is going"" real quick."
143	adjudicated	2	he had never had any type of sexual contact with a **live** female sometimes the use of a particular adjective completely changes the imagery of a sentence. this is one of those times.
144	adjudicated	1	for some reason i can't explain, i know saint peter won't call my name.
145	adjudicated	1	you're a real smooth criminal.
146	adjudicated	1	*satan gently nods*
147	adjudicated	2	what is an old jewish man doing selling masks in the middle of the afghanistan desert?
148	adjudicated	1	*my* clue is pointing in *that* direction!
149	adjudicated	3	"""side"" what ""side"" do you think i'm on? because i hate a fascist shitbag who tried to overthrow the country? why don't you? why would you support someone who did that, and why do you think he shouldn't be in prison?"
150	adjudicated	1	I named my horse Mayo. Sometimes, Mayo-neighs
151	adjudicated	1	and if you're doing it right it's on a corporate card lol
152	adjudicated	2	"true; but you're also paying for it to be ""right"". if you do it yourself and fuck it up, you don't get to send it back to the kitchen to be redone."
153	adjudicated	1	this.this scares me. edit: but also legendary.
154	adjudicated	1	for sure doing it at home yourself is by far the cheapest. steak restaurants always charge phenomenal amounts of money for steak.
155	adjudicated	1	when i was a kid i was one of the shortest and thinnest kids in my grade. when i was maybe 9 i went to a place called the hereford house and got the 32oz porterhouse. the table next to us and our waiter all remarked that the didn't know there all the steak went watching me eat with machine consistency. always cutting while chewing until no meat was left on the bone. after that i went for the fries soaked in steak juice only stopping for sips of coke. i guess what i'm saying is if 9yo me can eat 2% of my body weight in steaky goodness you should be able to eat half of that if you have the will power.
156	adjudicated	1	think we got a prime tomahawk from costco for $55 couple years ago. $55 between three people was so worth it.
157	adjudicated	1	smoked salmon, potato wrap, avocado, spiced cream cheese, rucula and iceberg lettuce.
158	adjudicated	1	What's in the pie?
159	adjudicated	1	looking forward to your submission on www.ratemypoo.com
160	adjudicated	1	the weight is half bone generally, probably more here given the length of the tomahawk here. granted 16 - 19oz is still a big meal for any dude.
161	adjudicated	1	citation very much needed
162	adjudicated	1	skin to skin contact soon after birth is especially important for c-section births to introduce the newborn to mother and parent's microbiome. depends on the hospital and baby's condition, but it can often be done in the or while the surgery is being finished up.
163	adjudicated	1	if you are talking about the skin microbiome (this is the germs / microbes on all skin and eyelashes) then babies obtain a lot of their microbiome from their mother during birth. they they will have additional colonisation through any skin to skin contact as well as their food. this microbiome is made up of lots of different types of microbes and millions of each and transfer very easily. if you are talking about eyelash mites, eyelash mites can also live on general skin. these are transferred from people with them on their skin / hairs / eyelashes to the hair / eyelashes on a newborn by touch. keep in mind that everyone has hair all over so this could be to anywhere on the baby and they can then move. it is also worth noting that not everyone has these mites and the same goes for newborns.
164	adjudicated	1	normal flora start spreading to the newborn as soon as they lay the baby on the mother's tummy, and it's one of the reasons caregivers advocate skin-to-skin contact between the parents and the child. once the colonization begins, it's impossible to keep normal bacteria from spreading to the entire body via hands and feet and bathing. is that the question? there are larger inhabitants than bacteria, such as nits, but they don't inhabit every adult nor every infant.
165	adjudicated	1	the seal / shark response still fits as baby seals can certainly fish for themselves for a while before fully grown. baby sharks, like all small fish are potential prey to marine mammals.
166	adjudicated	1	i don't think that any of the examples here understand the question. they're all giving examples of predators that, as babies, are sometimes hunted by adults of other species. op had an example where the predator-prey relationship reverses. in an immature stage, x hunts y, but when they (both) mature, y hunts x. since most higher species don't have young that do hunting, you'll probably have to look to less developed species for other examples. (i suspect that you might find other examples among insects, where larvae might be predators.)

169	adjudicated	1	i'm a bit skeptical about this paper. they only show three figured, with no error bars nor statistic analysis, a couple of uninformative microscopy images of erythrocytes and a diagram apparently made with paint. the wording of their abstract is also pretty vague, and even claims that the only treatment that currently exists to reduce blood viscosity is aspirin... i'd love to read the full paper, but it was published in a very little journal to which my university has no subscription and it is not on sci-hub.
170	adjudicated	1	I've always wondered, even within people who can see faces fine, we very often get cases where one person perceives two faces to be very similar, but to someone else they really don't. Is that explained by difference between how we perceive/process faces? Like each of us being partially faceblind to some subtle cues and not to others?

173	adjudicated	1	"you are correct. some mattress brands own review websites or they have a direct investment into a review site. mattress review websites generally aren't required to give a good review, but heavily influenced to do so. if you see certain suspect mattresses routinely at the top of various ""best of"" lists you can almost guarantee those mattress brands are simply paying the most money per sale. the mattress review industry by and large is dishonest. there are absolutely consequences if you you call out a particular mattress as bad or even just that don't like it as much as others. mattress brands stop working with you, remove you from their partner programs, reduce your commission, threaten legal action, sue you, they will negative seo your website (which causes rankings to decline), they will send dislike bots to your youtube videos (which isn't a big deal now that dislikes are turned off), and launch a myriad of other cyber attacks. all of the above have happened to me over the years."

175	adjudicated	2	when i was shopping for a mattress last year i ran across lots of review web sites and youtube channels, including sleepopolis. i came to the conclusion that most of these reviews are either paid for by the manufacturer or they are required to give a good review if they want to keep getting free samples to test. how honest is the mattress review industry? are there any negative consequences if you say that a particular mattress is bad?

202	adjudicated	3	regardless of if they caught the rapist it still will have a chilling effect on reporting. the police and da crossed a line here and deserve every bit of backlash they get.

216	adjudicated	1	my high school made me read *persepolis*. i didn't at the time cause i was a lazy high school student, but then i picked it up in college and really enjoyed it
217	adjudicated	1	"> ""it's a play, it's meant to be seen."" that's a great analogy. i've never thought about the relationship between plays and comics. movies vs. comics as a kind of storyboard, sure, but not plays necessarily."
218	adjudicated	1	"we had a brilliant youth librarian at our local public library. the local school system decided that all incoming 10th graders needed to read shakespeare's *the tempest* over the summer. the librarian stocked up on a version that was the entire play, in graphic novel format. when parent questioned it she explained, ""it's a play, it's meant to be seen."" i checked it out for myself. it was great because there were side notes on people and places."
219	adjudicated	1	visual rhetoric combined with text is powerful stuff. reading *persepolis* early in graduate school made me keen on graphic novels as a medium for communicating different personal narratives. then work like the provocatively-titled collection *get naked* showed me how persuasive they can be about understanding other perspectives. since then, i frequent the graphic novel section of my library and check out at least one a month, whether it's focused on something like the history of beermaking or whether it's something like *rusty brown*. i wish i'd known titles like this were out there in middle and high school, when the chasm between fun, picture-heavy, low-grade reads about history and solid text-only history texts never felt wider.

224	adjudicated	1	hey i think there's a super easy way to fix the problem with cats getting past your beautiful gate. add an identical extra magnetic latch at the bottom. the cat was able to get enough leverage to break the magnet's grip because the rest of the door served as a gigantic lever.

233	adjudicated	1	"the way to think of this is like a wing. with a head on wind, you can get wind to go across your sail and cause ""lift"", just like a plane wing. except, instead of going up, this lift pulls you to the side. now if the hull of your boat is angled at, say 45 degrees into the wind, this pull to the side from your sail will move you slightly to the side and sightly into the wind. eventually you'll run out of room or go too far off course, so you reverse the process, get the wind to pull you the other way, slightly to the other side but still going forwards into the wind."
234	adjudicated	1	the orbits of planets and moons *do* change over millions of years, but they'll still be orbiting around their respective primaries (stars and planets). for instance, the size of the moon's orbit around the earth is expanding about an inch per year. the l2 position is unstable. webb is orbiting around the sun, and it will continue to do *that* indefinitely, but it'll wander away from l2 without repeated corrections.

237	adjudicated	1	your food pretty much lasts the same length of time in your stomach one way or another. remember that your stomach is really only the second step of your digestive system - the first being your mouth, where you start the process by chewing the food into easily digestible goo. the stomach adds acid and enzymes, then the foodgoo goes on into the small intestines where bacteria gets to work and the useful proteins and nutrients are absorbed into the intestinal wall and enters the bloodstream to go whereever they're needed. you could (in theory) cut a hole into your abdomen and place unchewed food directly into the stomach, and it would still spend the same amount of time before being sent on its merry little way. but, by not chewing, the stomach and rest of the digestive system wouldnt be able to properly extract enough nutrients. meaning you wouldn't be getting the right amount, and would need to eat more...and you would be pooping a lot more.

240	adjudicated	1	"our forearms, the area between the elbow and the wrist, need to be able to rotate, like when we are turning a door knob. another way to think of this motion is pronation (making your palm face downwards) vs supination (making your palm face upwards). an ""armcap"" or elbow cap would get in the way of pronation/supination. the feet and shins do not need to rotate in this way, we are unable to make our toes point behind us for example, therefore it makes sense to have a more stable and rigid joint where the knee cap can act as a fulcrum or lever for more powerful movement."

264	adjudicated	1	"orbital *resonance* creates exceptions. pluto and neptune are in a 3:2 orbital resonance which prevents close encounters. pluto just got ""lucky"" settling into a stable orbit where neptune is always going to miss it. it gets to ""stay in the neighborhood"" by always being ""on the other side of the street"". if this new object is not in such a resonance then sooner or later it will end up on the wrong side of the street and lose a fight to neptune."
265	adjudicated	1	by the logic of orbital dominance, shouldn't neptune also be demoted to be a dwarf planet since it has failed to kick pluto out of its orbital path?
266	adjudicated	1	"it was the 9th ""planet"" by order of discovery and more distant than neptune at time of discovery, but if you count it as a planet and count the planets by distance from the sun, pluto was indeed the *8th* planet between 1979 and 1999 when it crossed neptune's orbit. this is of course also why it lost classical planetary status under the new definition and is now considered a dwarf planet. pluto and other kbo's like this do not meet the ""orbital dominance"" criteria of the new definition. they do not ""clear their neighborhood"" through the kuiper belt and would be heavily perturbed by an encounter with neptune."
267	adjudicated	1	"the ban on heliocentrism was largely because of galileo's writings being seen as contradicting scripture. the attack on copernicism in 1616 was prompted by galileo's writings. moreover, it made a number of invalid assumptions (including that the stars must be orbiting the earth because they don't appear to move, when in reality they are simply extremely distant and parallax is in fact a thing, though it wasn't measured for two centuries). in february 1616, the inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as ""foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of holy scripture."" kepler figuring out that the planets had elliptical orbits in the 1620s pretty much was the realistic end of heliocentrism, and once newton's physical laws of gravitation were discovered by the late 17th century, there was a mechanism as well."
268	adjudicated	1	well, as i understand it there were kinda two stages to the galileo affair. first was the edict to stop teaching heliocentrism. that was partly based on supposed contradictions with scripture, but mostly because the evidence (mainly stellar parallax) was against it. then galileo kept writing about it and teaching it while painting the pope as an idiot, so they put him under house arrest. that second part was pretty much dumb politics, but the initial edict was mostly based on science
269	adjudicated	1	well, the biggest reason was that galileo sort of implied that the pope was simple-minded.

304	adjudicated	2	i work in supply chain. the issues are real and not to be downplayed. a 40' container used to cost around $4k. it's now over $25k. the whole supply chain system is backlogged and outdated and in need of a major disruption. edit: rates are from eastern asia to western us

317	adjudicated	1	the best way to reddit is by engaging in communities you love and have interest in. you find you get to know individual users, have funner or even deeper conversations, and engage (usually) in a more civil manner. the bigger subs are fun to check in once in a while and easily ignored when they're going off the rails which is usually once or twice a month. the biggest subs however are repost and crosspost city made only to draw in attention of the outsider, the potential user. /r/all is all about being a twitter/facebook hybrid for new users.

391	adjudicated	2	jews followed a few traditions that in effect were more hygienic than their gentile neighbors... for one, quarantining the sick/ unwell has been a jewish tradition extending even to menstruating women being confined to shacks even in old testament times. ritual bathing traditions meant jews would bathe far more on average than their gentile neighbors. in the era shortly before the plague, many catholic societies started believing that cats were evil pests that report directly to the man downstairs, and many were killed on sight/ for sport... which the local rodent populations and the plague carrying fleas that came with them greatly appreciated.. meanwhile, the jews were still cool with cats, to the dismay of rodents and their parasites. furthermore, medieval anti-semitic prejudices often led to jews being forcibly segregated away from gentile communities, leading to a reduction of their risk of transmission since they lived in separate communities removed from the hot-zones of plague transmission. of course, when gentiles saw everyone around them but the jews dying in the thousands, they quickly wised up and worked with the jews to figure out ways to help them reduce plague in their own communities.... lmao! just kidding... they blamed the jews for the plague itself and massacred them by the thousands!
392	adjudicated	1	i heard a story that a bunch of sailors from iceland contracted the plague while in norway. their ship was supposed to sail back to iceland, but the sailors chose to stay (and die) in norway rather than risk bringing it back to icelandic shores. the black death never reached iceland. (plague eventually got there but it was like 50 years later.)
393	adjudicated	3	between your initial post and this comment chain, i can tell you that it is no simple task deciphering wtf you're even saying.
394	adjudicated	1	I watched a documentary on the ancient Polynesians. It kinda answered my question. Thanks!
395	adjudicated	1	the polish king, casimir the great, implemented quarantine in affected cities, so that could be a factor. poland was also less urbanized and more sparsely populated, especially after repeated mongol raids and civil wars. in later centuries, the black death hit poland very hard, especially during the deluge of the mid-17th century and the great northern war.
396	adjudicated	1	it has been a mystery that some areas, like italy, were devastated by the black death, yet others, like poland, seem to be relatively unaffected. the popular theory is that less is known about poland than italy, so poland's devastation was unrecorded. it could, however, be if this paper is true that many regions were unaffected. if these differences in the plague's mortality are established, we can then move on to find out why it happened.
397	adjudicated	1	"life must have been crazy before clocks. ""you're late. you were supposed to be here *before*."" ""sorry, i thought we were supposed to meet *later.* but since it's *now*, i'm actually early."""
398	adjudicated	1	the short version is that they didn't use them. for most of antiquity, the day was broken up between before noon and after noon. sundials and the like have existed for almost all of societal history but they weren't really ever in widespread use in antiquity.
399	adjudicated	1	as to your last point, a clock that is accurate at sea is essential for calculating longitude, but that problem wasn't solved until the 1750s, so i'm not sure that counts as antiquity.

401	adjudicated	2	> common sense and expert opinion are seen to reign supreme hah!
402	adjudicated	1	"in this interview, philosopher slavoj zizek explains how ideologies are part of our material practices, rather than some sort of psychological condition or state. ideology, he argues, is part of our reality. identifying the start of the 90s as the point at which the developed west ostensibly moved beyond the era of ideologies with the end of communism, zizek claims that even in the current period in which common sense and expert opinion are seen to reign supreme, still ideological influence persists. ""we are effectively in an era of cynicism as a form of ideology,"" he claims suggesting that even the rational advice of experts is framed within an existing system and carries 'secret biases'. zizek argues that the modern mantra of tackling practical problems first and foremost makes for a dangerous circumstance, with ideologies already present in the definition of problems. he goes on to discuss the demystification of political authority with the rise of populism, and how it has led to a role reversal between the political left and right, and how capitalism has reinvented itself in the wake of the pandemic."

405	adjudicated	2	you are too polite, imo. the states reached via minimum/maximum principles are in no sense optima. they are just the state that systems tend to. making value judgments about that state is ridiculous anthropomorphism.
406	adjudicated	1	"it is a stretch to say that nature seeking an optimal state (minimum or maximum in terms of energy) is the ""best world"". the title is a bit misleading as one might think ""best world"" refers to what is best for life or humans."

408	adjudicated	1	"i like this. it reminds me of ""sonder"". the realization that everyone else is living a life as vividly and complex as your own. to most people, you're not even a back story character; not even a blur from a passing vehicle. you will never exist to them. it might sound simple, but we tend to live and act like this isnt the case"
409	adjudicated	1	"i love this article. it's hard to conceive of time outside of its unfurling before us, or appearing to unfurl before us. one example that's always stuck with me with respect to this concept of ""tenseless"" time: imagine you're walking down a road. that's you, experiencing time, one moment at a time. things enter and exit your awareness - trees, passers by, clouds, birds, etc. as they enter your vision, it seems that they are coming into existence. as you pass them by, it appears they are ceasing to exist. but in reality, the things you experience on the road were there before you experienced them. let's say there's a mountain 100 miles down the road. it's already there, but you just haven't seen it yet. when the mountain comes into view, you might say that it has come into existence. your existence. this is how time exists. it's an extension of space. the time coordinate of a thing is another descriptor or property of the thing. right now, i am at x latitude and y longitude. and perhaps z height as well, in space, in the universe. but your place in time is similarly a property of you and your experience. we're just not very good at conceiving of future places in time, in the same way that an ant crawling on a piece of paper might not realize that it has a height dimension and can be rolled into a tube. the future is already there, just like the past. we're just locked into this road journey."
410	adjudicated	1	i would even say that stoics try to learn from criticism rather than that they try to ignore it. marcus aurelius famously even surrounded himself by people that often didn't agreed with him, because this way he would be triggered daily to reflect.

""she's not a fucking computer shaggroth! jesus christ!"" ""dude! not. cool."" ""gah! look hellspawn..."" ""hey!"" ""not you melissa!"" ""oh sorry."" ""okay, lemme run through this again. melissa, you acquired the vessel containing shaggroth at a antique store a few days ago right? ""i think so? the timing is a bit fuzzy honestly. i remember the store, and looking around. i saw the cute jar on a shelf..."" ""it's not cute! it is one of the finest possession traps crafted by the damned ever made!"" ""then why does it look like a kitten with a bow?"" ""shut up! it works okay?!?"" ""knock it off you two! melissa, please continue."" ""like i said i saw the kitten on the shelf, and all of a sudden there was a sharp pain behind my eyes. i remember swaying a bit, some flashing lights and people telling me to hold on.....oh! and then there was a long monotonous beep and i heard a voice say something about a intramural annual scrimmage. next thing i remember is being back home in bed."" ""intramural annual scrimmage? that doesn't make any sense. what would sports have to do...."" you stop mid sentence when it hits you. ""do you mean intracranial aneurysm?"" ""that's it! yes, that's what the floating voice said."" ""are you freaking kidding me?!?"" you scream as you throw the bible across the kitchen. ""whoa dude, i think you need to calm down. leave melissa alone."" ""can it shaggroth! the reason you stay in the body and melissa gets punted out every time i perform the ritual? she died at the exact moment you possessed her! she's not supposed to be in her body anymore. the ritual sees her as the demon and you as the rightful inhabitant."" ""so what does that mean?"" shaggroth and melissa ask at the same time. ""well honestly? i have no idea. that's above my pay grade. i'm sorry, at this stage i can't help you. here's the direct line to the spiritual inconvenience department at the vatican. hopefully they can help you. i'll be going now."" you undo the straps holding shaggroth/melissa to the chair and start gathering your holy items and return them to your case. on the way out you stop and turn, ""oh and here's your invoice. have a good day"". as you walk out of the house shaggroth/melissa stare at you slack jawed. just as you close the door you hear, ""wow, what a dick."" ""i know right? i am so leaving a one star review."""
446	adjudicated	2	that was a ride. it's incredibly dark and shows mankind at their worst and in a twisted irony also at their best. the message for me is, that there is no message. sometimes humanity just sucks, being human just sucks because you make mistakes and you have to make choices and sometimes all the options are horrible. there is no moral to learn here because history repeats itself as it always has and people make mistakes as they always have and then try to cover them up in the false sense that it will make it all better again. trapped in the illusion that everything will return to how it was before. very well written. thank you for sharing
447	adjudicated	2	"""you know and understand pain,"" tom speaks in a neutral tone distorted by the microphone, no word is accentuated more than another. he doesn't seem to register that you cannot answer, neither with your mouth or through gesture. ""in fact, no one knows pain better than you."" you're blindfolded, for your own psychological well-being. the world is easier in the dark than under the spotlight. you remember the white room, the smell of medical alcohol, the pricks of needles. it is still there. from the relative seclusion of your tank, you know tubes still enter your veins, can feel the rods in your back through the anesthetic. ""i readjusted the dosage, i hope you feel better,"" tom's voice goes in through a speaker, it is the only person speaking to you. the others think you can't hear them anymore, or rather, they convinced themselves you cannot. it's easier to go on with their job believing your consciousness is long gone, that your body lives without your mind. it wasn't for lack of trying, old scientists with glasses can be surprisingly creative when it comes to killing. first they gave you a drug and your heart stopped beating. they awaited the death of your brain for reanimation, this way they got to do science, not torture. then they decided to take over your vital functions one after the other, until your consciousness retreated forever in a dark corner. the tube in your nose gives you the oxygen, the tank both fully restrains and moves your limbs around to keep the flesh healthy. but your brain pulled through, so did your consciousness. torture became alright in the name of science and humanity. ""i heard south africa has pulled through, cape town and pretoria are still more or less functional. we will see the end of it, i promise we will,"" there, a hint of tearing up. not a single day goes by without you wishing for death. or what passes as a day in the dark, you lost the feeling of passing time and of yourself, except for pain. there. a burn, a bit, a sudden and violent tear, quickly soothed by the liquid going through your veins, and forgotten. ""i did it as fast as i can."" a life can be worth nothing, or it can be worthy enough to inspire a religion. yours is the only one that is both. when the dead rose, a group of scientists was quickly pointed out as responsible. they didn't deny it, science went wrong. you ran for your life like everyone did, you stumbled, you fell, and they gnawed at you, the vicious, rotten mouths... suddenly turning back to life. the first you saved were quickly eaten by the risen dead right behind them, and you would have died from blood-loss if it wasn't for the keen eyes of a child who witnesses the strange happenings from a distance. you're called a miracle from god. you, better than all, know there is no god. you knew from the moment the convicted scientists pointed out the facility used to create the virus was the only one with the machinery to keep you alive in a way to spread the serum to all the infected. ""i can't look people in the eyes anymore."" outside, they call the day you were carried to the underground facility a holy day, when you gave your life to save all of them. how many of them remember how you screamed and trashed against your chains? how many know the scientists working on you were the same who released the virus, believing to better mankind? it's easier to believe god intervened and forget the rest. belief. the tank, the drugs, the pain, all brought by someone else's belief. you lost yours long ago. here you are now. fed intravenously with substances made to help you grow the flesh back at a fast rate, a single being feeding billions of infected worldwide. ""it's going forward, one day it'll be over. it has to be. someone please tell me it will be,"" tom's voice sounds less robotic. you'd love to go insane or die, your idiot brain won't let you. they call you a martyr who will sit next to god. you wish for an afterlife to exist, if only to meet your zealots and show them how much you suffer. ""they grow restless. my colleagues. they know we'll only get to live for as long as we're needed. once it's over, there will be payback. it won't be pretty. we fear both the virus we unleashed and the end of it."" tom. you learned to pity the poor soul. he's the reason the group was spotted, he's the whistleblower, because he has a conscience, because he couldn't silence it. he can't ignore how you're still alive and thinking in there, it's his curse, just like miraculous flesh is yours. you're his morality pet. the kindness of words and voice he gives you is the only way to keep his tenuous grasp on sanity intact. it won't last long. you've heard him lose the soothing tone, the nihilism creeping into his words. for the rare times you hear his colleagues when they speak near the microphone, you know they are alright. they speak of everything and nothing, you're just an object with an assigned number. but tom, he has a heart, his sins weight on his shoulders. ""i'm thinking about you in there, okay? i won't forget you."" and that is why he's condemned to go insane in the end, the price to pay for empathy. from your tank, you can appreciate the dark irony. it's the only thing you can do."

449	adjudicated	2	"""huh, well that's not terribly reassuring."" the words ""very special episode"" echoed in your mind as your first waking thought, much as every other day for as long as you could remember. a title for the day to come ahead, as it were. sometimes these titles gave valuable insight in to things you might want to try and avoid or seek out, but sometimes they were about as helpful as an anti-vaxxer in a pandemic. titles often repeated, *not very imaginative are we mister life narrator?* you'd often thought to yourself, but then written it down in your journal and carried on with your day. actually, repeated titles were the norm at this point, after 29 years on this planet with a title a day for your entire life originality was non-existent. today though? today was new. new was exciting. new was scary. new needed an extra shot of espresso in your first cup of coffee of the day. february 14th, the calendar on your phone said. oh yeah, valentine's day. maybe you'd finally find that special someone who might last longer than a second date? someone who didn't just want you to pay for their dinner while they went to 'powder their nose' all too literally several times through the course of a meal out in a fancy restaurant. maybe it was the opposite. maybe you'd realise that you'd be forever alone, or eat the best burrito of your life, or join that trashy looking mid-20s woman in doing the fattest line of cocaine of your life and turning your whole existence to shit by crashing your car into a police station. who knows? you'd decided that uninformative titles were bullshit years ago, and today was unlikely to change that mindset. it was monday anyway, and due to the vagaries of your job's working hours today was the end of a rare long weekend for you. yesterday had been a hangover day, sat eating chips rewatching a series you'd seen about fifteen times on netflix, regretting, as usual, your impulse to drink away a day that had started with a title that summed up your life in one simple phrase. saturday's title had been ""a surprise at the club."" sunday's title had been ""time to go back to the std clinic!"", which really summed up just how badly saturday had gone, and just how unhelpful these ""titles"" could really be for your life. surprise indeed. today was a new day though, and it couldn't really be much worse than the last two, so with a renewed spring in your step and caffeine slowly clearing some of the fogginess away, you set out to get some breakfast from your favourite local delicatessen. ""huh, closed. maybe bob has a date or something. rather him than me if my love life's anything to go by."" it looked like the options were either mcdonalds, subway, or maybe that new sandwich shop just down the road that'd opened recently. as you were walking along the eerily quiet sidewalk, you couldn't help but feel like you were missing or forgetting something. even if the titles were a bit cryptic at times, and you were absolutely sure that no one else experienced them, they usually gave you *some* direction. you tried to think back over the last few days, had anything unusual stood out? sadly the cocaine wasn't that unusual, or any of the hookers. it was a sad existence living your life by an arbitrary title that your probably-a-mental-illness was creating for you every day. nothing jumped out at you until you thought about that morning. yeah, a strong coffee was always great, but it wasn't your alarm that woke you up was it? it was a day off so you hadn't set one but you were sure something had woken you up. something tickling at the edge of your mind, something important. the street was still quite empty. completely empty actually. how long had you been stuck in your thoughts? *huh, the new place is closed too, what's going on?* then a title popped up. wait, what? titles only appeared at the start of the day, never midway through. you were that distracted you could have missed it, but you never missed titles, they were too important. *bang* oh yeah. that was what had woken you up this morning, a gunshot. second title of the day: ""what are you missing? try again"" ##### ""huh, well that's not terribly reassuring."" the words ""very special episode"" echoed in your mind as your first waking thought"
450	adjudicated	2	"this was not the tinder date i'd expected. i always thought sacrificial virgins were female. yeah, i was strapped to an altar, naked as a jaybird, my hands and feet, my neck and hips, bound by straps attached to the sides of the slab. only my jaw and mouth were untouched, i guess so they could hear my screams of pain and terror. the cult leader intoned the rite to summon forth the demon that they worshiped. damned rite worked, too, because a large flame erupted at my feet and a creature nearly eight feet tall appeared within it. almost immediately, the smell of sulphur reached my nose. what a stink. ""oh mighty dlanod, we offer unto you this virgin as a sacrifice to appease you. accept it from your humble servants!"" the creature turned to me and smiled, licking his lips as he noticed that i wasn't what he expected. i guess he was accustomed to female type virgin sacrifices. ""what is this? you call this a virgin sacrifice?"" ""it was the best we could do, your mightiness. you barely accepted our last virgin sacrifice."" ""a four-year-old child isn't much of a sacrifice! tasty, yes, but an hour later, i was hungry again!"" ""hey, demon-guy,"" i shouted. ""how about i make you a better offer?"" the demon looked at me with a raised eye-ridge. ""a better offer?"" ""yeah. a better offer."" ""what type of offer?"" ""ask yourself, exactly why do demons want virgin females as sacrifices?"" ""oh, the exquisite flavor as we rip their souls from their bodies is beyond compare."" ""you're a demon! do you know what that flavor is? it's the flavor of their terror and screaming! i know jack the ripper was a demon, and he loved ripping the souls of the least pure women in lodon."" he looked thoughtful, nodded, and came to the conclusion that i was hoping he would: the flavor is in the terror, not the purity. or, in this case, pure terror was the actual flavor he really enjoyed. ""i offer up for your dining pleasure this room full of your disciples. they will scream to, pardon the expression, high heaven as you take their souls, one by one. the flavor will be their screams as the tides turn against them. they did not come here to sacrifice themselves. if you don't believe me, try him,"" pointing to the demon priest. i won't go into detail on how the sacrifice worked, but there was a reason sacrifices were always naked. it took dlanod on a few minutes to perform his part of the ritual: only a few drops of blood could be found around as he devoured the priest's body and soul. oh, the screams were loud as they resounded around the room. they were followed by more screams as he attacked others in the flock. after consuming a half-dozen of his worshipers, he looked at me with a satisfied smile on his face. he walked over to me and brought his clawed fingers down in an arc that i accepted as being a prelude to my time on this earth. instead, his claws split the bonds that held me. ""you've fulfilled your part. they were delicious! now, let's talk about your future"" my future was to find the most fearful beings for sacrifice. i thought long and hard on it and karma ended up being a demon named dlanod. i picked people that, while they might be missed, would actually improve society. take that ceo that constantly laid off people to improve his salary. he sure didn't live long enough to enjoy his multi-million-dollar bonus. remember that con-man televangelist that disappeared. there was a special place in hell for him, and that place was in dlanod's gut. a lot of terrorists ended up going that way as well. me? well, i took over the cult leadership. i advised them that they should be prepared to sacrifice themselves at any time, because if they prepared for it, they wouldn't scream and be as flavorful. this happened over three-hundred years ago. dlanod has been eating regularly and society has improved: even moreso after we worked on adding corrupt politicians into the mix. life is good, but afterlife is hellishly better."

461	adjudicated	1	no you're not pathetic. stop thinking that and stop living that. you are amazing. get a job, whether it's flipping burgers, gas station attendant or anything that you'd be ok with doing. i know that you will do great things in your life. this is just a starting spot.
462	adjudicated	1	it's really just math. earn more income. live on less expenses. invest in riskier things. the easiest one to control is life style.
463	adjudicated	1	how much bread? what are your expenses? do you have investments? does your employer offer retirement savings plans? contribution matching? do you have assets? can your wife earn an income while still raising your family? a lot of questions, i know. but you're asking a pretty complex question, and providing very little detail.
464	adjudicated	1	well, yes but it wouldn't be easy. i started grad school at 38 and doubled my income within two years of graduating. so, survivorship bias aside, it is possible to greatly improve income. your wife would need to go back to work and make a significant amount. consider that you are getting by with one income now and her second would be able to go toward your retirement savings, assuming the kids are past childcare stage. if you invest $1500/mo and get a 7% return, you'd have $1.5m by 70.
465	adjudicated	1	talk to your school counselor and hopefully school social worker to see what types of options may be available to you. you might contact child services to see if there is a requirement to provide until you graduate. put in applications and check your credit history to see if it has been used fraudulently. it may not seem like the best option, but the military might be what you need. you can still go to college for reduced rates while on active duty, air force is your best choice. edit: keep your head up little sis
466	adjudicated	2	no, not pathetic. i'm not even saying that to try and make you feel better about your situation. it's not pathetic. sad, unfortunate, but not pathetic. there's a solution here, and i'm sure someone here with experience or many here with similar pieces of experience can help more than this. i just don't want you getting down on yourself. that's how people stay down. you are on your way up, so keep that mindset. is it possible your mother was just misinformed and wasn't aware of her spread of misinformation? best of luck.
467	adjudicated	1	wild. but yes this is totally normal. many initial estimates of escrow are low due to rising taxes and insurance costs. i've gotten an escrow adjustment several times since purchasing any home i've owned. also, those taxes are crazy. but i also believe that it's probably accurate. the hard pill to swallow is that property taxes in other areas are a fraction of what you're going to pay. in my area you'd pay less than 3k on a 400k home.
468	adjudicated	1	you might have to check the law on that. i'm pretty sure that they could evict on other grounds, but if they did then they would have to return the unearned months less damages.
469	adjudicated	1	ask them how long you should depreciate land. they will love that.
470	adjudicated	1	also, by taking prepaid rent you might forfeit your option to terminate the tenancy and evict if the need arises for reasons other than rent.

472	adjudicated	2	"that is a foolish system. presumably your great-great-grandfather is gone for good now. you need to bring your father back. your great-great-grandfather is presumably beyond saving but you need, and let me emphasize this again, you need, to bring your father back. find some cousin who is out of the loop, and whom you've never met or never cared for, and convince him to wear your father's face. you need someone who knows the rituals to skin you when you die, and restore your face to someone else's flesh, so you are not lost after you die. you really want to put off finding out what happens to you when you eventually die a second time, for as long as you can. with no one to retrieve you, once your face rots away, i don't know if you'll go to the hell of your choosing, or the hell of your own making. oh, what a choice. to face st. peter, or to face an eternity lifeless, but knowing, unblinking and restless, buried in a grave somewhere. another thought. you need a cadet line to raid for bodies occasionally. ensure that ""your"" nephews are all married off and want for nothing. also work to drive them apart, so they don't know each other, (or necessarily tolerate each other's company), so when you ""harvest"" one, the others don't notice the sudden change of personality and learn just what it means. what a joy to be elected to inherit based upon your resemblance to an ancestor, your youth and good health, and your lack of a spouse."

(and of course the top voted comments are the ones making the brilliant logical leap to insider trading)"
513	adjudicated	2	isn't this buffet's usual strategy? i feel like i've seen multiple interviews and articles where he talks about buying when the rest of the market is reacting negatively to something. i mean this is famously how this dude operates
514	adjudicated	1	buying shares when they're undervalued is not insider trading. it's just smart investing. activision's shares were undervalued because of all of the harassment allegations, which made them a smart investment. lots of savvy investors bought at the same time.
515	adjudicated	1	yeah, i've never even bought shares before and i was hugely tempted to buy some of activision's shares. i was intensely frustrated when i heard about the acquisition, as i'd convinced myself it was too risky...
516	adjudicated	1	activision was considered a fairly safe bet at the time, the dip had already occurred, the scandals were blowing over and the shares were rising steadily and expected to eventually get back to around their original price. that doesn't take someone who knows a lot about tech, it takes someone with basic business knowledge and access to lots of funds they can accept a relatively small risk on. a billion dollars isn't even an eight of a percent of berkshire hathaway's current assets, this is the type of deal they have to make fairly regularly to keep their money going around.
517	adjudicated	1	gates is no longer on microsoft's board of directors and only ever owns between 1-3% of the company (part og the reason his wealth is a lot more tangible than musk and bezos). the much more reasonable explanation than insider trading is that an investment firm that's famously good at finding undervalued investments decided to buy into an asset that was in a big dip but that was already starting to slowly climb back up. the industry opinion at the time was that activision's value would go back to normal even if it took a year or so.
518	adjudicated	2	correct me if i'm wrong, but the article says he bought it at the peak of the sexual harassment allegations, when the prices were very low. a smart move because obviously activision was going to rebound from that.
519	adjudicated	2	not that there couldn't be something shady going on here, but i find i interesting how many people are saying there is no way a historically successful investor could see anything in this crap company, while not batting and eye at the fact microsoft saw enough to buy them. perhaps they both saw the same potential.

522	adjudicated	1	let's pledge to do something to change that
523	adjudicated	1	at face value, yes. it's an introduction to various forms of mindfulness/spiritualism too though, particularly with focus on meditation. it's really something else, i can't say there is anything else i have seen quite like it. helped me get back into more mindful self love practices. absolutely would recommend
524	adjudicated	2	unless i missed something, isn't it just a trippy animated podcast?
525	adjudicated	1	bro i cried at the end
526	adjudicated	1	the midnight gospel doesn't get talked about enough
527	adjudicated	1	until you made it your alarm...
528	adjudicated	1	there aren't enough midnight gospels memes
529	adjudicated	1	so you listen to it 100 more times, just to make sure lol.
530	adjudicated	1	dude this show was such a vibe
531	adjudicated	2	does everyone remember 2 years ago when the price of a barrel of oil went negative for a little while because no one wanted to store it? good. glad we haven't already forgotten. opec's response was to drastically cut their oil production (something wild like 80% or more) and even this week refused to ramp back up. the oil producers and oil companies want this so they can make record profits again.
532	adjudicated	1	except winner in the popular vote, which in most peoples minds means she should have won the whole thing.
533	adjudicated	1	my partner has been going through this for the past few years, i empathize with how stressful the last decade must have been for you. i hope sharing your victory with her will help her feel less isolated with what she's experiencing.
534	adjudicated	2	narrator: they aren't
535	adjudicated	2	24/7 news is just absolutely toxic no matter where they land politically. just shouldn't be a thing.
536	adjudicated	2	both sides are the same
537	adjudicated	1	i'm a bleeding heart liberal and find it exhausting watching networks like cnn or msnbc. i'll take pbs news hour or bbc world news any day.
538	adjudicated	2	thanks for the both sides take from the account with a scrubbed history.
539	adjudicated	2	cnn is pretty tame in comparison to fox news.
540	adjudicated	1	including hillary. she's not running again. it's just not happening.
541	adjudicated	2	yeah exactly. you don't pick healthy people for trials like this. you pick someone who is generally fucked and is willing to try crazy shit for science.
542	adjudicated	1	"al qaeda in iraq used to setup fake ""duds"", bombs they setup to lure u.s. bomb technicians, but they would have a live one nearby, or setup ambush/mortar attacks. one reason why we went to blowing things up, instead of dismantling the bomb."

548	adjudicated	1	most high explosives are extremely stable, you don't want them going off before you intend them to (like if the plane carrying it gets shot at). you can pound c4 with a hammer and it won't do anything. the fuse is a mini explosive that has enough kick to set off the main charge.
549	adjudicated	1	not really. in the slavic east, those kinds of expressions have been in popular vernacular since ww2. even kids use them.
550	adjudicated	2	most reasonable thing ive read here
551	adjudicated	1	this is especially true when you're new and trying to get into the habit of going to the gym. if you're having trouble going, even if you fire up a podcast and walk on the treadmill for half an hour, that's more than you would have done otherwise and you helped reinforce in your head that this time is gym time.
552	adjudicated	1	a crappy workout day is still better than no workout day. use those days to focus on fundamentals and form and you may learn something along the way, like better mind muscle connection, a better hand positioning, a better cue. don't obsess over increasing weight from the previous week if it ain't gonna happen that day. progress is more than gravitational flux.
553	adjudicated	1	i did the monkey bars for the first time in my life last week...at age 26 this is something most kids grew up doing but i was a pretty out of shape, indoorsy kid, unable to even hold myself on a rope in gym class so i'm just happy i can do it and it brings me so much joy to just do a couple back and forth at the end of my workout
554	adjudicated	1	i joined a gym this week for the first time in 4 years. not really a story but i wanted to tell someone.
555	adjudicated	1	the gym hired a new front desk chick 2 weeks ago. she was super friendly and loved the job. she worked closing and a few if the regulars would hang out after close and help her close down the gym. this week her husband came in the gym and threatened to beat up some trainer who she worked out with. she got fired so now the gym is short staffed again.
556	adjudicated	2	never skip anus day bro
557	adjudicated	1	"i'm a beginner in olympic weightlifting working with a coach at a gym that's basically a powerlifting gym on one side, and a weightlifting gym on the other. we were doing some snatch complexes when this dude walks over to me. i seen him before, he's by far the strongest lifter out of all of us on the weightlifting side of the gym, after my set he walks over to me and my coach and goes, ""you're starting to look real good out here man, keep it up"" it was a very nice feeling to have someone who has obviously put so much time and work into their sport, come over and sort of welcome me into their world. i believe a gym atmosphere like that is a big part of what keeps people coming back"
558	adjudicated	1	"i'm really proud of my progress. i can power clean and press 115lb with strong form. i could only do 8 reps consistently. i'm a tiny, short, mexican chick but seeing my self lift near my body weight was a proud moment for me. also- i have noticed my traps have gotten larger and more ""mountain"" looking and i am here for it. it has significantly improved my power cleans and shoulder presses."
559	adjudicated	1	"for those of you old enough to remember duke nukem, there is a guy in my gym who looks exactly like that. now every time i see him i have ""i got balls of steel"" repeating in my head."

562	adjudicated	2	thiel has said that he doesn't believe democracy is compatible with his brand of freedom... so for us to live in the libertarian utopia he envisions, we are going to have to have a dictatorship.
563	adjudicated	3	will you be retracting this comment now that the shooter has been detained?
564	adjudicated	2	so basically if you're serving your country overseas, texas just flipped you the bird. how patriotic
565	adjudicated	3	he needs to be constitutionally barred from running for reelection.
566	adjudicated	2	fascism is okay when it's their guy.
567	adjudicated	2	ultimately, mcconnell knows there's really only one way he's going to be able to thwart trump permanently, and that is to support the findings of the january 6th committee (which will likely continue to implicate trump directly in the insurrection) and then whip \[read: ***buy***\] however much gop support he can for participation in the invocation of section 3 of the 14th amendment. i think all of that will hinge on how well trump-backed candidates perform in the primaries this year. if they fail, mcconnell has all the ammo he needs to see this through to the end, and that could come as soon as this summer. in fact, such action would probably be *good* for gop turnout in the fall because all of the legal battles over the 14th amendment would have republican voters foaming at the mouth. if trump's people win in significant numbers, buckle your chinstraps because mcconnell is not going to outright sabotage the gop ahead of 2 crucial elections in '22 and '24. if it's a wash, it will all depend on *where* trump's people win. if they only win nominations in rabidly republican strongholds, mcconnell may still move forward with a plan to extricate trump from the party to whatever extent possible, albeit more muted than he has been recently. if trump's people win nominations in races that will be competitive in the general election, everything will depend on their performance in the fall. tl;dr: if trump-backed gop candidates get wiped out in the primaries this year, mcconnell has very little incentive to keep giving him any cover. if not... our long national nightmare is far from over.
568	adjudicated	2	this was the only goal of the new laws. that's why we call them voter suppression laws.
569	adjudicated	1	they have been calling them rinos.
570	adjudicated	3	lol. old school republican tries to shame a modern republican. theres no shame there. modern republicans have zero shame. they will lie, they will grift, and nothing shames them.
571	adjudicated	2	we created a society so reliant on cars that drivers face basically zero repercussions. whats that saying? if you want to get away with murder, use a car?
572	adjudicated	1	that's how my fallout character walks around most of the time
573	adjudicated	1	because of course they didn't.
574	adjudicated	1	not sure. they didn't have insurance so i almost ended up getting nothing. got the value of my car back and that was it.
575	adjudicated	1	so what was the drunks punishment?
576	adjudicated	1	that's the scariest part. 6 years ago i got absolutely wrecked head on by a drunk guy driving without a license, this guy hopped a 4 foot tall median in an f350, which spun his truck sideways, his truck then continued it's sideways trajectory, totalled my car (f350 vs honda civic) and sent me to the hospital. you just don't know if or when that moment will happen that will completely change your life. luckily i'm still okay, but i remember the slow motion effect of witnessing my life potentially getting completely destroyed.
577	adjudicated	3	"there's no ego bruise in letting some asshole go up ahead of you. it's actually better to let them go create pressure somewhere else. good on you. i had a friend that was always trying to ride up on the person in front of them and block out anyone trying to squeeze in. i asked him, ""what are your options right now?"" ""what?"" ""you're nose to butt with the car ahead of you, and there's a psycho boxing you in to the right that may try to cut in at any time. the shoulder on the left is super narrow and full of debris. what if someone flys up from behind? what can you really do?"" ""don't tell me how to drive."" ""don't make me passenge like this."" person in front can brake hard any moment person on the side can run you off any moment anyone can hit you from behind, especially if the line ahead stops dead it's just never in the best interest of safety to be boxed in and close to others. if you can't make it around slow-moving groups of vehicles, then that's your life for a time. wait until a path opens up and then break free. until then, leave space. let the free radicals move about. give yourself an out if anything fly's toward you from any direction. calm your ego and be safe in the flow of the river of metal boxes. besides, the biggest ego validation is letting an idiot go ahead and go nowhere. if they're especially peppy and cause an accident ahead, you just slow down and go around them. if they think they cracked the code on traffic, they just keep seeing you there, same amount of progress, while you're just chillin. to stay on point. yes! the mirrors are where the predictive action is. as long as you're not barreling toward what's up ahead, it's whatever; the real spice comes from the rear periphery."
578	adjudicated	2	it's not for no reason. it's because someone had to check facebook or something at that moment.
579	adjudicated	3	yeah, if anyone's not regularly checking your mirrors once a minute or so (or more often) you really should. there are many, many times i've been on the highway and seen someone speeding and weaving between traffic way behind me. allows me to be prepared for whatever dumbass stunt he'll try to pull when he eventually passes me.
580	adjudicated	1	i follow this guy in ig and he's actually crazy strong. he's using really light bumper plates and does this joke often. he'll even be on a skateboard sometimes (of which he's also awesome at)
581	adjudicated	2	translation: that might hurt our bottom line so we will make up whatever bs to try to stop it
582	adjudicated	1	my dad was with the usda when this happened, the meat companies swore that putting in a window was physically impossible to do, it would destroy the structural integrity of the packaging.

586	adjudicated	1	is this really a life hack or just common sense?
587	adjudicated	2	looking through a window designed for the purpose of checking the meat is a lifehack?
588	adjudicated	1	you're gonna have to wait.
589	adjudicated	2	this looks like how a fancy restaurant would serve a $38 portion of banana
590	adjudicated	1	works great for strawberries too!!
591	adjudicated	1	it's the right typeface but the wrong font size.
592	adjudicated	1	location is why it's not a perfect comma.

597	adjudicated	2	my asian parents disowned me for peeling plastic
598	adjudicated	1	so much more protection when they need to go overseas. here in germany they just stand on the back of a truck in the rain on a sunday if they stay domestic / in europe.
599	adjudicated	1	new car day was the best when working as a dealership tech. got to unwrap and test drive every one of em. easiest day of the week.
600	adjudicated	1	i could barely afford to watch this video.
601	adjudicated	2	"sorry but it's not 'curiousity' or 'wanting to know your thoughts' or broaching the topic when you bring up the subject by immediately requesting to have an open relationship. if you are in a long term monogamous relationship and come up to your partner one day saying ""hey, i kinda want to fuck other people, are you cool with that?"" you should be fully prepared for them to not take that request well. it doesn't matter if it wasn't a dealbreaker for her, because the request itself was a dealbreaker for you. you broke up with her and adequately informed her why, despite some people claiming you should have elaborated more or gave her 'closure.' it doesn't make you insecure or immature if you don't want to stay with her or have a big lengthy emotional break up."
602	adjudicated	1	just to piggyback on one tiny point of this comment- i would get unbelievable ingrown hairs in my armpits and no matter if i shaved or waxed or sugared, they were unbearable. painful and red and itchy. randomly one day when cleaning up my undercut, i decided to use my hair clippers on my arm pits and wouldn't you know, no bumps! no burn! no ingrowns! if this is her issue, suggest the clippers.
603	adjudicated	2	not meaning to disagree here, that's actually a great tip imo, but trying to add to this. about the awkwardness. girlfriend posted on her ig-account about some jewelry the op had given her, and within hours the ex was on the phone, demanding a meeting. just let that sink in. how often do you check your ex's current girlfriend's ig-accounts? perhaps weekly? sorry, this is creepy. op proposed to his girlfriend on the two-year anniversary of them dating. dating started one year after the ex herself had started dating again. that's three years total. and the ex was calling him up, on his vacation, against agreements about that, completely devastated. this fubar has already become so awkward, a few instagram account settings really aren't going to make a big difference anymore.
604	adjudicated	2	exactly! *he's* the one slowing op down!
605	adjudicated	3	> trauma caused his behavior? yeah, and i'm guessing a girl accused at college of something he didn't do? i'm guessing sexual assault/rape, and further, he did do it. fits with the racisms as well, entitled, and resentful as fuck. if he's the golden boy in the extended family, then it fits.
606	adjudicated	2	"oh good, someone noticed the details here. the post could literally be summarized as ""i have a hot young fiancee and i'm rolling in cash money and my shrivelled old wife is wailing like a banshee like an actress in a spanish soap opera"""
607	adjudicated	2	i don't know what is going on with her, but you are enabling it. just tell her you aren't buying all the things she wants and she should fend for herself. but you have to stick to it. it might eventually mean breaking up. by the way, it's actually cheaper to cook from scratch than to buy frozen entrees, etc., but it requires you to not be too fussy, and requires a fair amount of kitchen management - using up all you buy, keeping track of when things expire, etc. cooking from scratch also doesn't mean cooking every day. it's healthy and safe to make a relatively large batch of a stew, chili, etc., and eat that for several days.
608	adjudicated	2	she won't believe you probably he will convince her you are crazy sadly
609	adjudicated	2	partly because you're accepting and enabling the behaviour. you need to set clear boundaries and a strong stance on this or she is going to keep walking over you.
610	adjudicated	2	only a few messages where we talk about the trip planned for him to visit on facebook. . one blurry photo. that's it. it was 4 years ago, so old messages were lost from old phone.
611	adjudicated	1	the best part is there's absolutely no traces left behind! sry for crappy quality lol i don't have reddit on my pc yet
612	adjudicated	2	boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew
613	adjudicated	1	he's using aternos and the max render distance, at least on my server is 15 chunks, and yeah aternos is a weak server, but free so i can't complain
614	adjudicated	1	you can change this in the servers config file but be careful this impacts the performance, especially if you are using a weaker server with more players
615	adjudicated	1	did it, thanks
616	adjudicated	1	are you playing on a server? the server caps the render distance. even if you set your's higher, it wont have an effect. did you change the render- or simulation distance?

631	adjudicated	1	currently in buenos aires for a month, my brother and i walked around the ecopark, rose garden, and the area around the planetorium enjoying the light breeze and sunny vibes. as i was heading back to the apartment, took a quick snapshot and was pretty pleased with the results. i hope ya'll enjoy! the picture really does capture everything: families chilling, couples enjoying each other's company, lost tourists.

636	adjudicated	1	looking back from 70, you'll never regret the experiences you are having.
637	adjudicated	1	"when we went in 2001 someone told us travel to ghana is ""africa for beginners"". we loved cape coast, accra and tamale."
638	adjudicated	1	pictures are mostly from tamale area in the north and volta in the east. the people are wonderful, accra is also a very interesting cosmopolitan city. next time i will be sure to check out cape coast which i sadly didn't get to this trip.
639	adjudicated	1	honestly, i feel like i'm forever in the minority on this one but i liked venice. it's a truly unique city with its own culture and history. the architecture is among the most interesting in italy. and yes, parts of it are dirty and smell. so does every other touristy city in europe. you're going to miss out on something. you'll see a lot in 8 days but italy has sooo much to offer. so just prioritize what you want to get out of the trip. if you want to not feel exhausted, i recommend spending more time in tuscany and doing day trips from there. if you want to see as much as possible, take a day off of your rome trip (which you really only need 3 days for) and spend a day in venice. no need to feel fomo. you're going to have an amazing trip no matter what you do
640	adjudicated	2	"they probably also say they are 5'8""-6'0"" tall."
641	adjudicated	2	then she's a moron.
642	adjudicated	2	what if she considers the president as her god?
643	adjudicated	2	her thinking is so regressive that it went a full circle and now seems progressive
644	adjudicated	2	that's really insulting to the monkey
645	adjudicated	2	and we get to hear the rich people complain that they have lost millions, but they still made more than we see in a decade.
646	adjudicated	2	"yeah, once you leave hs, they are just another adult. i had a similar situation but said, ""just give me a b then, bc i'm not doing more work than other students."" i got an easy a."
647	adjudicated	2	"i guess the guy who did this don't understand one bit about psychology and just did it because ""hey, i'm the representative of this area and i must show my people that at least i try to do something about suicide problems"""
648	adjudicated	3	have they found the missing link between monkey and this bitch? oh wait. there is no missing link
649	adjudicated	2	imagine the mind of a suicidal person, they literally think they are a burden to the world and that both them and the world would be better off without them existing. how the hell does showing them pictures of those with a far better life and possibly far more of a positive contribution to the world make them feel better?
650	adjudicated	1	shoegaze dad is spot on with this comment. not a facepalm, unless one of despair at the fate of the working classes.
651	adjudicated	1	it's the casual walk after for me
652	adjudicated	1	thought this was going to be worse. my uncle had a nasty scar on his back from playing around with a double bit when he was a kid(think he was 10 or 11 at the time). went to whip it back to throw it, and put it right above his kidney. missed hitting anything vital or any bone. this sort of thing was a trend with my uncle. he is the same one that had an attempted diy firework(bunch of black powder in a toilet paper tube) blow up in his hand. walked away with only some superficial burns. he had a sort of uncanny luck.
653	adjudicated	2	dangerous animals should be put down. then they can get the dog a new owner.
654	adjudicated	1	why shouldn't you have water in your kitchen?
655	adjudicated	3	seemed like the owner was in on it so fuck him too.
656	adjudicated	1	an all out fire is pretty bad too.
657	adjudicated	1	good cameraman.. good boy
658	adjudicated	3	fuckthemup
659	adjudicated	3	you taunt an animal this is what happens. mf'er got what he deserved along with the owner.
660	adjudicated	1	wouldn't it be a 3rd hole?
661	adjudicated	2	why. if children know what to do when they see a gun, then the odds they do something stupid are significantly reduced. in a perfect world people are responsible and keep guns locked in safes where children can't get them but does this world look perfect.
662	adjudicated	3	there was a thread on (i think) unpopular opinion that stated children should be taught proper gun safety. 90% of people lost their fucking minds over it
663	adjudicated	2	no one is going to comment on him putting a jacket on like it is a dress?
664	adjudicated	1	given the sheer amount of guns here and the easy access i would 100% much rather my child know gun safety and how to handle them. there's way too many accidental shootings of all ages.
665	adjudicated	3	absolutely. me as a german looking at this, i can't fathom how someone can feel something remotely positively about a 13 year old shooting proper guns. wtf us and a?
666	adjudicated	2	god it's so weird watching these as a non american. what's next level about this? someone educate me please.
667	adjudicated	2	do american realise this shit is only normal to them?

670	adjudicated	1	service animals are so interesting. another redditor posted a video of a sheep herder talking about the different dog jobs and different behaviors of each animal. so wierd that different dogs are born knowing different jobs in the same farm

672	adjudicated	1	finally someone who isn't scared of 1080p
673	adjudicated	1	exactly what i was thinking, but been using the card for a week now and it runs perfect. the guy was pretty old and was selling off stuff from a laser printing company.

675	adjudicated	1	>the guy had no clue what he was selling he probably posts here on r/pcmasterrace...

679	adjudicated	1	i blame (/s) jay for convincing me to try out custom loop water cooling. which is pretty scary. and became less scary because i am now imagining my pc as an expensive aquarium. no pressure. except when the pump has no pressure, that is bad.

692	adjudicated	2	i'm low maintenance af and it's still more expensive to be a woman. bras cost a lot. menstruation products aren't cheap either. shampoo and conditioner and any home hair product is more than that can of murray's that lasts men 5 years. we even use more toilet paper. compare the price of men's toiletries to women's. just making a razor pink means they mark it up 10%. that generally applies across the board. obviously some shit is more luxury than necessity like the lashes she mentioned but don't say it's not pricey to be a woman. that's just untrue.
693	adjudicated	1	agreed because it's been proven women's soaps, deodorants, etc are more expensive than mens.
694	adjudicated	1	and feminine supplies like tampons, sanitary napkins, birth control

731	adjudicated	1	for several reasons: previous hammers were purely political and can only come down if you have a solid congressional majority. because trump replaced enough of the top of the republican party with loyalists he will always be able to evade those hammers. this one is a completely different because it's a legal hammer. he was immune to legal hammers as president, but he's not president any longer. legal hammers routinely take 3-7 years to come down because if you try to go too fast then safeguards kick in and prevent it from coming down at all. trump has also spent his entire adult life stalling legal hammers for as long as possible. there were many times when drawing out the process for as long as possible and then hitting any loophole or deficiency in the system hard at the right moment he was able to get out of trouble. that's how he handled civil rights claims and property disputes and bankruptcy cases. he didn't come out unscathed but he came out better than he should have. he tried to do the same thing with the election. file all of the lawsuits, make the loudest noises, stall as much as he possibly could, and hit any ambiguous wording in the rules as hard as he could. it just didn't work. it also doesn't work in criminal cases. the rules and standards that he has spent decades mastering ways to frustrate and defeat aren't the same. so, trying the same things that worked before is probably going to go badly. there's also a very real chance that the northern district of georgia is going to file election interference charges in july. the process is slow because those are not easy charges to bring and it's georgia. but, that call to the georgia secretary of state has a very real chance at making him ineligible for office ever again.
732	adjudicated	2	trump going to jail or facing consequences is always 30 years away just like nuclear fusion.
733	adjudicated	2	the hammer is coming down. the hammer has been coming down for quite a while now. an uncomfortably long time, in fact. did they drop it from orbit? is that why it's taking so long?
734	adjudicated	2	he'll pull some legal fuckery to delay and appeal until it ends up in front of his 6-3 scotus
735	adjudicated	2	everyone on reddit acted like trump was mere hours from being arrested and dragged out of the white house every day of the mueller investigation, so yeah, maybe random reddit posts are not the best source of info on this topic.
736	adjudicated	1	"i fully expected to click the comment and see that it said, ""none. he's never been held accountable, and this will not affect him."""
737	adjudicated	2	this reminds me of when mueller was investigating and reddit was just desperate for that to be the day trump would finally pay for being trump, and then not much. this isn't a movie, reddit, trump isn't going to finally fall screaming and burning to the bottom of the canyon after some hero throws him off the cliff once and for all. he's going to grow old and die, somehow still rich. wake me up when there's a consequence, too.
738	adjudicated	1	there's been a well-written, highly upvoted comment in r/politics saying trump is right at the cusp of total humiliation and disgrace every day for.. 6 years now. it isn't that i don't believe them or that they're wrong, it's just that i've heard this all before.

754	adjudicated	1	i can take it off your hands in exchange for my trusty 2070 super
755	adjudicated	1	"assuming you're asking about the ""gaming oc"" part and not the 3070 as others have addressed what to expect out of a 3070. the gaming oc is a solid sku, above the reference style sku (evga black) but a bit below cards like the ftw3, strix or gaming x which have beefier power delivery and even bigger cooling solutions. the gaming oc still has a decent factory oc and solid triple fan cooling solution. if you're looking for a ""good"" sku that isn't as over the top as a strix or ftw3 it's a good choice."
756	adjudicated	1	my gigabyte oc 3070ti is a monster in 1440 144. i have yet to find a game it can't handle ultra or very high for the settings. damn fine card. now it is a bit warm, and i had to get a slightly larger case for better air flow, but now it won't go above 63-67c while gaming under full load. before it was hitting 70-76c (was really close to thr psu shroud in my small mid size that i had). not good airflow and only a single intake and exhaust. now i have 3 intake and one exhaust and it's nice.
757	adjudicated	1	all 3070s are more or less the same, the only noticeable difference between brands are temperatures, noise and customer service. if the quality of the card is a concern its a fantastic card, but ask yourself do you need/want a 3070ti or 3080 and are you prepared to pay the extra to get one?
758	adjudicated	1	it's perfect for 1440p gaming. there are better cards but then you're getting into the big bucks top end cards

824	adjudicated	1	those are examples of centralized crypto projects and don't represent all others. there are crypto projects that solve censorship, it's just that ethereum isn't one of them.
825	adjudicated	1	except crypto doesn't solve the problem. sole individuals have pressured the three big pools in ethereum to block certain wallets (by not processing transactions from them). law enforcement has gotten tether to block hundreds of addresses on the ethereum block chain similarly. the issue that most crypto solves is double spending, not censorship.

833	adjudicated	1	> half twist off the attached lens sounds like a great way for your lens to fall off your camera. my method is this: 1. put lens cap on 2. take rear cap off lens in bag 3. twist off lens that is on camera and place into empty spot in the bag 4. put new lens on 5. put rear lens cap on lens in bag 6. take off lens cap and place in bag or pocket. i do this with my left hand while hold the camera in my right hand. i can do the whole thing in about 10 seconds.
834	adjudicated	1	i set the camera down on top of the dividers to my bag, pop off the lens, pop on the new one, put on any caps that arent already on and continue with what i was doing. my rf lenses are all 3k+, wouldnt risk fumbling around holding onto everything standing.

875	adjudicated	1	this is all to real for me here in michigan. last year my daffodils got a nice snow blanket after blooming beautifully. they survived.
876	adjudicated	1	this is too funny! and oh so real. especially when you have a full week of spring-like days, then a sudden frost shows up out of nowhere with a vengeance.
877	adjudicated	1	more like absolutely jacked fruit.
878	adjudicated	1	absolutely gorgeous color
879	adjudicated	1	this is the same one, he's actually updating you with graduation pics
880	adjudicated	1	my man's over here bathing dark souls bosses.
881	adjudicated	1	stfup you are loved.
882	adjudicated	1	no no you have a point
883	adjudicated	1	Sorry to hear about your father. But yes, always remember to keep your pinky up. Water is for quitters.
884	adjudicated	2	dying alone gang where u at make some mf noise
885	adjudicated	2	oh sorry to hear that. let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin.
886	adjudicated	3	looooser looooser edit: yes this is an sb reference not a diss.
887	adjudicated	1	you see spongebob and patrick are doing the right thing, both here and the original. they never moved.
888	adjudicated	2	wondering how much effort and time was putted in this video
889	adjudicated	1	Excellent piece and tribute to your dad. I'm sorry for your loss
890	adjudicated	1	this is a masterpiece
891	adjudicated	1	"guy on the left: guy in the middle: ""no that's how you do it."""
892	adjudicated	1	fun fact: that's how you actually take off chainmail they're so heavy that there's no point in trying to raise them above your head, so you just lean over and let it fall down. i believe that's also what the image is trying to point out
893	adjudicated	1	i love this sub. mates just point and laugh.
894	adjudicated	1	he's just planning for the the spanish inquisition
895	adjudicated	1	wow that neckbeard it's like a second jaw
896	adjudicated	1	he's just treasuring the moment before he murders them in cold blood.
897	adjudicated	3	nah fuck that. club em.
898	adjudicated	1	i'd only want the best for them and to wear their face.
899	adjudicated	1	at first glance, the goat looks like it's wearing a backwards baseball cap.
900	adjudicated	1	jesus christ in the year 33 before christ?
901	adjudicated	2	people don't realize this but in india there are times when a man is kidnapped by members of his own family and forced to marry some woman they chose for him. it's happened to many of my relatives and almost happened to my dad.
902	adjudicated	1	it's true, i'm men
903	adjudicated	2	looks like south indian. so men are usually 8 or more years older then their wives. also they are mostly arranged and it's gonna be miserable.
904	adjudicated	2	arranged marriages are forced on both parties, so many comments assume the groom here is some kind of evil misogynistic ass when they could both be not into this.
905	adjudicated	3	listen here you piece of shit..
906	adjudicated	2	i would say a core memory of receiving the message that she is powerless and unimportant, that her feelings don't matter, and that the adults closest to her cannot be trusted to show basic respect and consideration to her.
907	adjudicated	3	shitty human vibes
908	adjudicated	1	why not both
909	adjudicated	2	core memory of sadness or anger
910	adjudicated	1	That's some serious comedic talent in one short clip.
911	adjudicated	2	just because you put your food on a board doesn't make it charcuterie. good lord
912	adjudicated	1	my wife is lebanese. we thank you for including the mandatory orange drink
913	adjudicated	1	well i think gyro contains chicken , so basically no ! this is a dough like pizza dough and a herb called zaatar is spread on it with olive oil and is put in the oven then mint , onions , tomatoes , olives and cucumber are put on it and wrapped ! also you cam go to amy arabic store or pastry shop and order it !
914	adjudicated	1	very good , that was my favorite breakfast back when i was a kid !
915	adjudicated	1	the hdr on this bad boy cranked to 1009
916	adjudicated	1	i know nothing about lebanese food, but damn that looks good
917	adjudicated	1	that's a shit ton of brussel sprouts
918	adjudicated	1	ok it's decided. going out today to buy a propane griddle.
919	adjudicated	1	up north here that's probably 75 bucks worth of steak.
920	adjudicated	1	i have got to get me a blackstone. enjoy
921	adjudicated	2	yes, this. not saying it wasn't the appropriate move for those kids but your son has been put through it. and then you adopted kids to help. he has a lot of trauma. he is very resentful of the adoption. he is hurt by his father's actions. he is probably hurt that you took on more children instead of focusing solely on your own. he is not acting out because of nothing. he is a very hurt and scared little boy. he barely tries because he is scared of his future. he needs real help. he needs a bigger therapy course now. and you say you are in most of his sessions with him? he needs sessions all his own so he can actually open up.
922	adjudicated	1	in my opinion there should be no such meetings involving such small children without the parents present. there should possibly be a meeting between you and the school without any children first.
923	adjudicated	1	this. if your kid is sick, keep them home please. i'm recovering from an awful stomach bug i got from my toddler because some idiot sent their kid ill less than 48 hours after vomiting. i'm seriously worried about my 8 month old catching it.
924	adjudicated	1	"hi! i used to work with kids like yours. it's rough as fuck. there's no ""good"" way out of where you're at because you're already - more importantly *he's* already - way in over his head. so everything is going to feel like shit for everyone, but a key point to take away is this: he can't learn to make good decisions if he's not being provided with *useful* feedback. what makes feedback useful is basically three things: immediate, unambiguous, and brief. this feedback loop is actually exactly what makes video games so satisfying. they've been designed to make the gap between mistake and consequ short, clear, and let you redo. contrast that with what just played out with the chores: the feedback (consequence) was delayed (the week was already over), unambiguous, and permanent. you're going to need buy in from him, but that's only going to come by leaning on your relationship which sounds like it isn't doing so hot right now. he needs to really feel like you're on his side. that's going to take time reinvesting in that relationship. or, you can also quite fairly say that you've done enough. that he's nearly an adult and will reap what he sows. at a certain point, this has to be the next step, and where that point is can only be up to you"
925	adjudicated	1	i was bullied and assaulted on school grounds, and was coerced by the social worker *to apologize to my bullies because i made one inappropriate comment toward them*, and they didn't notify my mother. there was no faculty supervision when i gave my truly heartfelt apology over my callous and thoughtless words. they beat me up again (my mom was a single mom who worked nocs and was often forced into am shifts, so she didn't see me until after everything was said and done). the second time all students involved were permanently expelled from the school district and had to bus out to another county for the rest of their school career. i realize i was 14 years old, not a young child, but do not trust faculty to handle this situation in an appropriate manner without a parent present. especially *because* your child is a young child, it is even more important that you be present.
926	adjudicated	1	have you considered it's the adoption of the siblings that's the issue? it sounds like the must take up a lot of your time and resources to raise them? especially considering their backgrounds?
927	adjudicated	2	some of these comments are scary. like have people heard of rsv? it ain't just covid overrunning pediatric er's right now. what may be a runny nose for one kid is a stay in the pediatric icu for another kid who may have been perfectly healthy before. you can't play around with stuff like this!
928	adjudicated	1	"just to give you perspective from the other side, or maybe why daycares have this policy: my daughter was born when my son was 17 months old. my son was in full time daycare before i went on mat leave, since my husband and i work full time. my husband got 1 unpaid day off when each kid was born. we decided to keep my son in daycare half time, since i couldn't physically take care of him (lift him into his crib, etc) but couldn't afford full time while i was on leave. a parent sent their child to daycare with ""just a cold."" my son brought home ""just a cold."" what presented as ""just a cold"" in toddlers actually was meningitis and my 6 day old daughter was in the picu for a week, where we weren't sure if she would live. this was pre covid. i understand how frustrating it must be to have your childcare solution be changed at the last minute, but i'm so grateful for daycares that have this type of policy to protect those that aren't able to protect themselves. while it might seem annoying to have to work around your work schedule with a runny-nosed child, it is probably easier than managing a hospital stay with a newborn. so i get it - but there is another side."
929	adjudicated	2	"i say this as a teacher: i would not allow my child in a meeting with the bullies without my presence. i would not trust the potential manipulation and frankly the comments made at this point are far beyond the level a 7 year old should be dealing with. this isn't ""heather called me names"" this is a serious allegation that needs to be taken as such, not handled in a mediated conversation with an ap who is not trained in these types of conversations."
930	adjudicated	1	a death threat? easy. just call the police. that's way beyond school jurisdiction.
931	adjudicated	1	99% fiat is held by 1% holders.
932	adjudicated	1	this is quite literally the definition of fiat currency, and as elementary as it can get. he's not so much admitting anything as he is explaining some basic fundamentals on how modern currency works.
933	adjudicated	1	"i mean this is textbook stuff, it's not like he accidentally disclosed a fed secret and was forced to ""admit"" anything, and now at long last, the cat is out of the bag."
934	adjudicated	1	"as coin bureau just tweeted: ""know this: the money in your bank account is one ""state of emergency"" away from being the government's money.."""
935	adjudicated	2	the chinese have been driving real estate pricing thru the roof in all of canada's major cities through laundered money and a couple paltry changes have done nothing. a few truckers get together and bank accounts are frozen and companies are directed to hold payments. wow
936	adjudicated	1	it's interesting that canada now considers bitcoin to be money. this is a beginning of recognition, even if it is done in an aggressive way.
937	adjudicated	2	but money laundering in housing is ok.
938	adjudicated	2	bitcoin was never intended to be used to evade taxes or be anonymous. some of you completely miss the point of crypto and it shows.
939	adjudicated	1	and they say bitcoin is useless!
940	adjudicated	1	yeah what happened to bitcoin being not real or a scam? if it was, it wouldn't be on any watchlist.
941	adjudicated	1	ok, but what about languages based on number of jobs
942	adjudicated	1	i still prefer static html for smaller projects, never breaks, never needs maintenance :)
943	adjudicated	1	awesome! my grandfather learned to make simple websites (just html) in the late 90s when he was in his 60s. then he taught me and i've been hooked with computers ever since.
944	adjudicated	2	karma farming with three year old news.
945	adjudicated	2	> not arrested ? > > you can surrender yourself to the police. ah thanks, i will !!
946	adjudicated	2	> it's a running joke in the crypto communities. crypto communities are the running joke
947	adjudicated	1	i used to work with a few ad agencies. we did two web sites specifically for super bowl ads. each time budget was 10% functionality, 90% testing/infrastructure/scaling. with larger agencies this was expected (and they are not budget conscious). smaller agencies pushed back on and we actually rejected more than one project based on lack of understanding/willingness to pay for scaling.
948	adjudicated	1	the bean-counters told them that spending millions on a superbowl ad was capex, but spending half that much on developers salaries is opex, and increases to opex aren't in the budget.
949	adjudicated	1	"in the third paragraph where it says ""3 x 109 letters long, or some 3 gigabytes""- should it instead say 10^9?"
950	adjudicated	1	they were using a text format where each nucleotide was reprented by an ascii character, so it would've taken 1 byte even though there were only four combinations. as for *why* they were using a text format, i'm guessing it's because ease of processing was more important than storage space. if you squeeze in each nucleotide into 2 bits, you need to decode and re-encode it every time you want to do something to the individual letters, and you can't leverage existing text processing tools. i have zero evidence for this though, so take it with a bucket of salt.
951	adjudicated	1	that mustve sucked seeing all that work setting up just to have that happen
952	adjudicated	1	what's infuriating here? i think you just lack humor, op.
953	adjudicated	3	to all the idiots saying its the nazi symbol: op said it was from the 1800's and nazis did not exist back then this same symbol was and still is the hindu peace symbol the nazi one is rotated
954	adjudicated	1	he did say it was spongebob, not his wealthier cousin who can afford pants, spongebob squarepants esq.
955	adjudicated	1	grr, 12
956	adjudicated	2	there's so much wrong with this order
957	adjudicated	1	wow. there's no wall in my house big enough for an 85' television!
958	adjudicated	1	spongebob ate them all, you can see he's got his cheeks full. guilty-ass looking piece of disposable kitchenware
959	adjudicated	1	yeah sorry i'm just wound up from the stress
960	adjudicated	1	alright, my bad! plus, a big ass tv like that one surely comes with warranty. i was just joking :(
961	adjudicated	1	very nutritious but they smell like death.
962	adjudicated	1	i sprout mung beans in my desk
963	adjudicated	1	i'm pretty sure that's actually an american dish but yum!
964	adjudicated	1	"it can also be mixed with rice or pasta stretch those items and cut calories. this works great for mexican / asian style ""bowls""."
965	adjudicated	1	bean sprouts are another awesome alternative. like cabbage, they're cheap and it's easy to cook in bulk if you're just interested in quantity of food. they can also be super nutrient dense. my favorite use of them is with stir fry, where they make a decent substitute for noodles.
966	adjudicated	1	i bulk up soup with cooked, pureed zucchini. it makes a good base for tons of stuff.
967	adjudicated	1	cabbage is cheap and it's bland enough that you can use it sliced or shredded as a substitute for rice or pasta in most dishes.
968	adjudicated	1	eggs are cheap, nutritious, and keto approved. you can also use steamed veggies to bulk out a meal. depends on where you live but around me there are bags of frozen steamables for like a buck at walmart and kroger. big leafy salads are good for stretching your budget too. spaghetti squash is great too, you get a ton of food from one squash and you can use it very similarly to pasta. it doesn't taste the same but it's really good with a keto alfredo, chicken, and spinach or broccoli.
969	adjudicated	1	oh damn, this is like the perfect answer. never even considered sous vide but that would work amazingly. i'd get the benefit of using water while not having to introduce water directly.
970	adjudicated	1	i cut it so it's thin rectangles, and use garlic powder, salt, and pepper. cool it in light oil for 2.5 minutes a side until golden brown. usually 2 flips
971	adjudicated	1	lucky those horns aren't sharp. same could be said about the dude
972	adjudicated	1	have balls. would rather take a bonk in the donk than have my femoral artery torn open by a steer.
973	adjudicated	1	Lol I love how the girl in the middle takes a bite out of the fruit and puts it back in her friends drink
974	adjudicated	1	yeah if he was aggressive it would look a lot different / this video would be on another sub
975	adjudicated	1	bro watched one episode of greys anatomy and can now diagnose anyone with a detailed list of injuries.
976	adjudicated	1	they're usually pretty self-aware of their horns, but i think he was enjoying the scritches too much and got carried away!
977	adjudicated	1	good piece of advice, steer clear of the horns on animals like that
978	adjudicated	1	lucky it didn't gore into his thigh and cut the vein! i'd rather a hit in the beans over a life threatening injury any day! lol
979	adjudicated	1	that could have been much worse.
980	adjudicated	1	pow! right in the watusi.
981	adjudicated	1	this is so cool! did you make that border yourself?
982	adjudicated	1	just put them in a time capsule and bury it where twinleaf will be.
983	adjudicated	1	"it didnt fit in my ""favorite of each type"" panel, but got really close to be on it. it has a really simple design and is kinda cute imo. plus i think it was kinda rare in hg/ss (i think you needed to get a call by a specific fisherman)"
984	adjudicated	1	to be honest, overqwil is such a cool name
985	adjudicated	3	kick the baby
986	adjudicated	2	i know, right? my pokemon takes a nap and i just want to sit next to them and pet them. and while we're at it, why can't i send my pokemon out in my own goddamned house??? ... i just wanna sleep with them next to my bed.
987	adjudicated	1	at that point, having an alpha, having a shiny, and having an alpha shiny (with every variation for f/m) would be 100%. gotta get that dex complete complete.
988	adjudicated	1	this is really the area i'd like to see them improve on in future games. just general ui and menus. the clothing shop should list by overall clothing type first and only then open up a list of color options. the hairdresser shouldn't charge you until after you've selected options to change, being charged just to even look at the options even if you don't intend on changing your current style is silly. npcs that sell/buy unique things in bulk just need options to pick how many you want to sell/buy, not only have options to pick between like 1, 5, or 10 at a time. when selling things to the general store you really ought to have the option to sort your item box. just things like that.
989	adjudicated	1	to me 100% is completed pokedex, not shiny charm. but its debatable lol cause the 100% dex is really that long, shiny charm not so much
990	adjudicated	1	"100% as in prefected every single dex page? or as in getting the shiny charm? i've seen people set wildly different metrics for ""100%"" the game"
991	adjudicated	2	the funniest part is that you believed him.
992	adjudicated	2	not only that, but just like the medical industry- the discussion is never about cutting costs, it's about shifting the payment burden. any politician who isn't talking about making it cheaper, but making other people pay for it is lying about what is going to happen.
993	adjudicated	1	that's not student debt cancellation at all.
994	adjudicated	1	>ends lol
995	adjudicated	1	orrrrrrrr just repeal the recent the law that prevents people from using the existing law that's been around for 100+ years which was created to help people solve this exact problem... bankruptcy. what do you think happens when colleges and those companies that issue college loans know that you have to pay the loans back no matter what? they charge more.
996	adjudicated	1	or when harris said she'd propose a bill in which we'd receive $2000 stimulus every month until the pandemic ends.
997	adjudicated	1	i'm looking at the way back machine around the election for his website and see nothing of the sort. i'd be interested in seeing a specific date for such an easily provable claim. i see the same thing every click > we are the nation that built the hoover dam and the transcontinental railroad. landed a man on the moon. cured polio. built the internet. sequenced the human genome. and we will be the nation to end cancer as we know it. > this is the history of the journey of this country: it's one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. i believe that as much today as i did when i got elected to the united states senate as a 29-year-old kid. but we have to remember who we are. at our best, america has always thought big. that's why the negativity, the pettiness, the small-mindedness of our politics today drives me crazy. we're better than this. > it's time to reach deep into the soul of this country and once again give everyone and i mean everyone the opportunity to achieve the impossible. it's time to look beyond 24-hour news cycles and 140-character arguments. it's time to treat each other with dignity and respect. not as opponents, but as fellow americans. because that's what we are. > this is a time for big dreams and american possibilities. if that's what you believe and you're ready to help elect folks who believe that, and to support groups and causes that embody that spirit then i'm asking you to join me today.
998	adjudicated	1	"despite what schumer thinks can be solved ""with a simple stroke of the pen"", there is no easy road to blanket loan forgiveness under the higher education act. it doesn't matter if it's a $10,000, $50,000, or a complete write-off of the debt. the only certainly is this: an executive order which forgives student loans (in part or in full) will be challenged in the courts, and then it will die in the courts. in the meantime, this issue will be politicized even more, making it that much harder for congress to pass any sensible loan forgiveness legislation. congress has always been the way forward on this issue."
999	adjudicated	2	you've been played like a fiddle.
1000	adjudicated	1	I love this movie. Perfect.
